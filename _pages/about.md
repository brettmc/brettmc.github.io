I'm a web/database developer, who loves working on back-end stuff (because I suck at making things look pretty).
I started out as an Oracle Forms developer back in 2002, but at some point I switched focus to PHP.
I predominantly work on PHP/Oracle applications, and have recently started to work with docker a lot.

My passions include open source, postgres, docker, PHP, and complaining about things.
